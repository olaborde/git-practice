// Practice making objects. You need to use them a lot when you code for real. Do the following:

// Make an empty object
const empty_object = {}
// Make a property for your object that can be accessed with a dot notation.
// Make a property for your object that can only be accessed with the bracket notation.
// Get the value of a property with the dot notation
// Get the value of a property with the square bracket notation
// Set the value of a property with the dot notation
// Set the value of a property with the square bracket notation
// Make a method. Call this method
// Make a method that takes in an argument. Call this method
