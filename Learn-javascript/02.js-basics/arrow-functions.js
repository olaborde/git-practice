// Arrow functions are important. You'll see more and more arrow functions in the future. We're also going to use them a lot in this course. Make sure you're familiar with them.

// For this lesson, do the following:

// Make a function named ten that takes in zero arguments and return the value 10. Try using both () and _ syntax.
const ten = _ => console.log(10) // with ()

ten()
// Make a function named logger that takes in one argument. It logs the argument you passed into it. Try it with and without parenthesis ().
// Make a function called add that adds two numbers together. Try it with and without implicit returns
// Make a function called multiply that multiplies two numbers together. Try it with and without implicit returns
